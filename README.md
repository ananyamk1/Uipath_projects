RPA - Robotic Process Automation
RPA enables ease in deploying and managing software robots, who, just like us humans, can do things like understand whatâ€™s on a screen, complete the proper keystrokes, navigate systems, identify and extract data, and perform a wide range of defined actions. But software robots can do it faster and more consistently than people, without the need to get up and stretch or take a coffee break.
